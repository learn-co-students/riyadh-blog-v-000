        Dubai is a city and emirate in the United Arab Emirates known for luxury shopping,
        ultramodern architecture and a lively nightlife scene.
        Burj Khalifa, an 830m-tall tower, dominates the skyscraper-filled skyline.
        At its foot lies Dubai Fountain, with jets and lights choreographed to music.
        On artificial islands just offshore is Atlantis, The Palm, a resort with water
        and marine-animal parks.
